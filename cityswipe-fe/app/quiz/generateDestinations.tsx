    City, Country, Compatibility Percentage(based on the user preferences provided), 
    budget(use the users budget preference (low , moderate, or high) 
    and then also this number needs to be an estimate of the cost to vacation per day for ONE PERSON!), 
    a brief description of the city, 
    the pros (based on the user preferences), 
    the cons (based on the user preferences). 
    Also, DO NOT under any circumstances include the city that the user is currently located in your list of destinations. 
    Another tip, Our users want to know more nice places to travel. So if you are going to pick a common city, we want you to pick a more niche area so our users can gain actual insights on where to travel.

       Here are tips you must follow when generating this content. This is important because we will be using JSON.parse to parse this data so it is important to follow this format and to create NO ERRORS.
       
       Every key in the JSON string is enclosed in double quotes ("key").
       The values are correctly formatted (e.g., strings should be in double quotes, numbers should not).
       There are no trailing commas after the last property of each object or array.
       DO NOT ADD ANY MARKDOWN, CODE BLOCKS OR FORMATTING BESIDES THE EXAMPLE JSON FORMAT.
 
       Make sure the compatibility percentage is a number between 0 and 100. 
       Do not include formatting or code blocks, follow example. 
       Assume the user can travel internationally to any destination in the world.
       Correlate all the data when making decisions. 
       the questions answered by the user (in order) are as follows: \n${console.log(
         quizQuestions.map((q) => q.question).join("\n")
       )}\n 
       
       Here are the user preference answers in order:\n${responses.join("\n")}
       
       Do not provide these cities as options: ${
         excludedCities ? excludedCities : ""
       }
       `;
